#DESCRIPTION
This is a simple C language project that implements a basic data compression and decompression tool using the Run-Length Encoding (RLE) algorithm.

ðŸ“Œ Features
âœ… Compresses text files using RLE

âœ… Decompresses RLE-compressed files back to original form

âœ… CLI-based input/output file handling

âœ… Lightweight and beginner-friendly code

ðŸ§  How Run-Length Encoding Works
Run-Length Encoding compresses data by replacing sequences of repeated characters with a single character followed by the count of repetitions.
Example:

Input:a3b3c4d2
Compressed:a3b3c4d2
Decompressed:aaabbbccccdd
